S.O.L.I.D: The First 5 Principles of Object Oriented Design

S.O.L.I.D is an acronym for the first five object-oriented design(OOD)** principles** by Robert C. Martin, popularly known as Uncle Bob.

These principles, when combined together, make it easy for a programmer to develop software that are easy to maintain and extend.
They also make it easy for developers to avoid code smells, easily refactor code, and are also a part of the agile or adaptive software development.

S.O.L.I.D stands for:
S - Single-responsiblity principle <br />
O - Open-closed principle <br />
L - Liskov substitution principle <br />
I - Interface segregation principle <br />
D - Dependency Inversion Principle <br />
