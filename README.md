S.O.L.I.D: The First 5 Principles of Object Oriented Design :shipit:

S.O.L.I.D is an acronym for the first five object-oriented design(OOD)** principles** by Robert C. Martin, popularly known as Uncle Bob.

These principles, when combined together, make it easy for a programmer to develop software that are easy to maintain and extend.
They also make it easy for developers to avoid code smells, easily refactor code, and are also a part of the agile or adaptive software development.

```
S.O.L.I.D stands for:

S - Single-responsiblity principle
O - Open-closed principle
L - Liskov substitution principle
I - Interface segregation principle
D - Dependency Inversion Principle
```

##Single-responsibility Principle
```
S.R.P for short - this principle states that:

A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job.
```

##Open-closed Principle
```
Objects or entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
```

##Liskov substitution principle
```
 Every subclass/derived class should be substitutable for their base/parent class.
```

##Interface segregation principle
```
A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn’t use or clients shouldn’t be forced to depend on methods they do not use.
```

##Dependency Inversion principle
```
Entities must depend on abstractions not on concretions.
It states that the high level module must not depend on the low level module, but they should depend on abstractions.
```
